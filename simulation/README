tvAuction simulator
==========================================

this script allows to test the tvauction processor by generating a configurable set
of advertisement slots and bidding behaviors. in order to adjust these values, please
refer to the "--help" page if the script. for more information about these parameters
please refer to the next section.

apart from generating and solving the scenarios configured, the simulator can also
generate a number of graphs and logs regarding the process of iteratively adjusting
the price and the final assignment of prices to the winning bidders. these files will
be saved under '/tmp/tvauction_simulation'.

configurable parameters
------------------------------------------

1.    define quantities
       - slot quantity (int)
       - bidder quantity (int)
       - slot maximum duration (int)
       - slot price (per second), in steps (list[float])
       - advert maximum duration (int)
       - advert maximum price (per second), float
       - campaign minimum priority vector sum ranges (min/max, as percent), (int,int)
2.    define reserve price distribution
       - constant: all slots have the same price per second
       - normal: the prices are normally distributed
       - uniform: the prices are uniformly distributed
3.    define bidding behavior
3.1.    - define distribution between priorities
           - constant: all bidders will have the same priority vector
           - normal: the differences in the priority vector will be normally distributed
           - uniform: the differences in the priority vector will be uniformly distributed
3.2    - define relation between reserve price and priority vector
           - fixed: there is no correlation between the reserve price and the priority vector
           - linear: there is a linear correlation between the reserve price and the priority vector
4.    define slot duration distribution
       - constant
       - normal
       - uniform
5.    define advert duration distribution
       - constant
       - normal
       - uniform
6.    define advert price (per second) distribution
       - constant
       - normal
       - uniform
7.    define the minimum priority vector sum (as a fraction) distribution
       - constant
       - normal
       - uniform
note:
   the final campaign price will be calculated using the following formula for each bidder:
    bidder_attrib_min = Î£(bidder_prio_values) * campaign_prio_sum / 100
    campaign_budget = advert_price * ad_duration * bidder_attrib_min
